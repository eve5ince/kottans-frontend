## 0. Git Basics 
  Completing the task, I've learned basics of Git. Since this tool is new for me, I was really surprised by incredible important possibilities of version control.   
  Now, using command line, I can initialize repositories, add files on staging index, make commits, point tags; create branches, developing safely and isolated, merge branches together; undo or modify changes that have been saved to the repo.

## 1. Linux CLI and Networking
#### Linux CLI   
  As I am newbie to Linux, finishing this chapter was actually valuable. The command line seems very powerful tool, especially with git, and I am glad to know how to perform basic tasks with it.

  Some commands to remember:
* cp -r, rm -r - copy/remove files on trees 
* chmod(ugo-rwx) - change file permission 
* finger - show user info
* ~ - home directory
* df - show free disk space
* ps - show system processes
* kill, kill -9
* grep - find words in text
* man - manual  
#### Networking
  Reading articles about Networking, I got known some of HTTP's basics: request verbs, status codes, request/response headers, using HTTP in web frameworks; also HTTP connections, connection handling, authentication, HTTPS, and cache processing.   
## 2. Git Collaboration   
In this task I've learned how to work with remote repositories: how to push or get changes from remote repos; forking a repository; looking in CONTRIBUTING.md file and project issues, before start doing any work; working on "topic" branches; creating pull requests; squashing commits with rebase command, and the importance of communicating clearly and frequently with other stakeholders in the project.

## 3. Intro to HTML and CSS
Mostly I have refreshed HTML/CSS knowledges; some were new for me, such as !important flag, which overrides any style; CSS Grid properties: grid-area(a shorthand which specifies an item's location and size), grid-template-areas(allows the naming of sections of a webpage), grid-auto-flow(specifies whether implicity-added elements should be added as rows or columns within a grid), grid-auto-rows(implicitly-added rows or columns occur when there are more grid items than cells available); also I find CSS transition pretty cool tool, which allows you to provide visual feedback to users.
